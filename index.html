          <p class="aboutMeInfo">
            Hello I'm Cole Powers. A 2018 UMass graduate that has a passion for
            problem solving, coding, Japanese, and just overall improvement.
            I like the feeling of improvement and really challenging myself.
            Whether it is practicing guitar, Japanese, or solving new bugs that
            I haven't run into before while coding, I enjoy the feeling of
            improvement I get.
            <br>
            My hobbies are studying Japanese, fishing, games, electric guitar,
            comedy, and recently reading light novels. I started learning Japanese
            while I was in college. At first I was only taking 16 credits per
            semester and really felt that I had too much time on my hands and decided
            now would be a good time to learn a second language. I chose Japanese
            because of how different it is from English, the pronunciation, and
            the difficulty level. I'm really glad I learned Japanese and having a fun
            class everyday to look forward to during college really helped me.
            Now because of it I've been able to expand my hobbies. I've always loved
            comedy but never knew about the different style of Japanese comedy,
            particularly Manzai style comedy, that I find hilarious. Also I started
            reading Japanese light novels to study but actually found out that
            I really enjoy reading now. And sometimes I find myself watching more
            FujiTV than I should be.
